## Why use SIGMA
Ever wanted to open a picture in your text editor?

Sigma stores its colors in an intuitive plaintext manner.
Instead of allocating mere bytes tot pixel color data,
we use a full plaintext description from the CSS 3 color set!

To get started, just open `main.py`.
There are to functions to use: `from_sigma()` and `to_sigma()`
